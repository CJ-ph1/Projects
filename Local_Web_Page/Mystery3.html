				<p>Author: Wilkie Collins<br>
				Characters: Walter Hartright, Laura Fairlie<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				This Wilkie Collins’s late Victorian novel is among the earliest psychological thrillers ever written. 
				It follows what first appears to be a simple story of two star-crossed lovers — Walter Hartright and Laura Fairlie who weren’t meant to be together. 
				Laura was betrothed to Sir Percival Glyde and yet she was mysteriously warned not to proceed with the marriage. Meanwhile, 
				the city is gripped by the story of a strange woman clad in white who’s roaming its dark street. As the title suggests, 
				this final character is the key to the mystery that will enshroud these characters. Set in dimly-lit streets, 
				The Woman in White is as much Gothic horror as it is mystery book, and that’s precisely why the clarity you get when the riddle is solved is so incredibly satisfying.
