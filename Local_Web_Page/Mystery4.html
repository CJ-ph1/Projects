				Summary:<br>
				Before there was How To Get Away With Murder and Suits, lawyer related entertainment came in the form of criminal cases. 
				Anatomy of a Murder, written by a Supreme Court Justice under the pseudonym Robert Traver, is such a classic. 
				It follows lawyer Paul Biegler and his defense of Frederick Manion, who’s accused of murdering an innkeeper. 
				While the case is overwhelmingly against Manion, his unreliable behavior leaves room for challenges against conviction, 
				and that’s where Biegler and his seemingly laid-back attitude comes in. This thrilling courtroom drama will keep you on the edge of your seat, 
				wondering how this lawyer can argue such an impossible case.
