				<p>Author: Dan Brown<br>
				Characters: Robert Langdon<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Dan Brown knows how to write up a riddle just read The Da Vinci Code and you’ll see. In this volume, 
				Professor Robert Langdon is brought to Paris on a whirl to shed some light on a bizarre murder in the Louvre. 
				As he and sidekick cryptologist Neveu tries to decode the artistic riddles left at the scene, all of which are related to the works of Leonardo da Vinci, 
				Dan Brown takes readers scrambling through the City of Love, speechless (because of the shrewd puzzles and not Paris’ beauty, of course). 
				You can imagine Dan Brown spending hours meandering between paintings and statues in Paris before coming up with this elaborate quest that Langdon embarks on. 
				The story thus produced is shockingly satisfying to read, and it will no doubt leave you wanting to travel to France’s capital just to retrace Langdon’s steps.
