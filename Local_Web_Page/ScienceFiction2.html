				<p>Author: Isaac Asimov<br>
				Characters: Hari Seldon<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Asimov was a prolific writer, but many of his best works are classic short stories such as Nightfall, or The Last Question, 
				which play out like long jokes with a punchline twist at the end. In the Foundation series, he’s in another mode entirely, 
				charting the rise and fall of empires in sweeping brush strokes. Asimov’s prose can be stilted, and betrays the attitudes of its time in the portrayal of 
				female characters, but it has left a lasting legacy.
