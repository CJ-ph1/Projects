				Summary:<br>
				Anna Kavan's last (and best) sci fi novel provides a haunting, claustrophobic vision of the end of the world, 
				where an unstoppable monolithic ice shelf is slowly engulfing the earth and killing everything in its wake. 
				The male protagonist and narrator of the story (who is nameless) is eternally chasing after an elusive and ethereal young woman, 
				while contemplating feelings that become darker and more violent towards her as the ice closes in. He frequently crosses paths with the Warden,
				the sometimes-husband but also captor of the young woman, who is always one step ahead. And as the ice closes off almost all paths by land and sea, 
				he is running out of time to catch them up.
