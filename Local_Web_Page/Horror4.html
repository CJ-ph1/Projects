				<p>Author: Ray Russell<br>
				Characters: Laird Barron<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Two priests are called in to examine a girl who might be possessed by the devil. The Exorcist, right? Nope, 
				it’s Ray Russell‘s The Case Against Satan, a novel of theological horror that beat William Peter Blatty’s book to print by eight years. 
				The Case Against Satan is as much the story of a crisis of faith as it is a supernatural tale, and readers looking for a nuanced take on both should give it a try.
