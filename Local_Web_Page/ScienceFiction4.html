				Summary:<br>
				If you think you know Solaris from the 2002 Steven Soderbergh film, the original book may come as a bit of a surprise. 
				Written by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem in 1961, this short novel is heavier on philosophy than plot. It follows a team of humans on a 
				space station who are trying to understand the mysterious living ocean on the planet Solaris, with little success â€“ their research is limited to lengthy 
				descriptions that paint a vibrant picture of the alien planet but fail to elucidate how it works. As they poke and prod, Solaris ends up exposing more about 
				them than it does about itself, with the book demonstrating the futility of humans trying to comprehend something not of their world.
