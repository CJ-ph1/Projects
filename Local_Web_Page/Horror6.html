				Summary:<br>
				At some point in your life, you’ve likely done something and then forgotten about it later. So begins Sara Gran‘s odd and eerie novel, Come Closer, 
				as she’s called in to her boss’s office to explain a series of quite offensive insults written on a report she submitted to him. Later that night, a 
				quiet but persistent tapping is heard throughout her and her husband’s home. What follows is a series of events that will keep you up late at night, 
				turning page after page as the dread sinks into your bones.
