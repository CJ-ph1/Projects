				<p>Author: Raymond Chandler<br>
				Characters: Philip Marlowe, Eddie Mars, Joe Brody<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Raymond Chandler’s idea of mystery strays from conventions for him it’s less about the intricate plot and more about the atmosphere and characters. 
				As such, The Big Sleep is no ordinary story: private eye Philip Marlowe gets hired to investigate the blackmailing of Carmen Sternwood, 
				the second daughter of a wealthy general. The further he digs into this messy business, the more complicated the story gets, 
				as Carmen continues to be blackmailed by others in a web of unexpected relations between the characters. Chandler’s work is complex: 
				his characters are multi-faceted and his language rich with premonitions of the tragedy about to fall on this family. While the signs he 
				drops are not exactly there to help you find out “who done it”, it will definitely give you a foreboding awareness that makes it hard to put the book down.
