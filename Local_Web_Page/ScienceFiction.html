				<p>Author: Margaret Cavendish<br>
				Characters: The Empress<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				This book is arguably the first science fiction book ever written. The Blazing World's language may be dated, 
				but this fearless feminist text from Margaret Cavendish is packed full of imagination is not just incredibly brave for its time. 
				It's also still incredibly relevant; cited as inspiration by writers including China Mi√©ville and Alan Moore. 
				Cavendish's utopian tale follows the adventures of a kidnapped woman, who travels to another world run by part-humans, part animals - fox men, 
				fish men, geese men, the list goes on. As she is a very beautiful woman, she becomes their Empress, and organises an an almighty invasion of her own world, 
				complete with literal fire(stones) raining from the sky.
