				<p>Author: Victor LaValle<br>
				Characters: Lillian Kagwa, Apollo Kagwa, Emma<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Apollo Kagwa’s excitement to become the father he never had to his own newborn son transforms into a parent’s worst nightmare 
				when his wife and child are torn away and Apollo becomes determined to bring them back. LaValle brings a piece of classic Western European folklore to the modern day, 
				a cautionary fairy tale and a stunningly creepy horror story all in one.
