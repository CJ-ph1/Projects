				<p>Author: Toni Morrison<br>
				Characters: Sethe, Baby Suggs, Denver, Paul D Garner<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				It’s difficult the crushing emotional weight and deep-seated sense of dread that comes with each page of Toni Morrison‘s Pulitzer Prize winner. 
				At its base, Beloved is a classic ghost story centering around a former slave beset by otherworldly torments tied to a long-buried and horrifying secret. 
				In a larger sense, it is an examination of guilt, the lengths desperation can push an individual, and the psychological trauma of slavery. 
				Beloved is a novel of singular and devastating power.
