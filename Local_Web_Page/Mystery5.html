				<p>Author: John le Carré<br>
				Characters: George Smiley<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Packed with interesting codenames and stressful covert actions, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is about an ex-spy, George Smiley (codename Beggarman), 
				who is pulled out of retirement, to his relief, to weed out a Soviet mole in the British Intelligence Service. 
				You’ve probably never seen the motto “Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer” in better action than this, as 
				Smiley attempts to distinguish the double-agent amidst old partners. There are plenty of clever hints and details about these cryptically named 
				characters that you can pick up on, thus joining Smiley on the race to safeguard his country. From deceit to elaborate tricks, le Carré’s espionage masterpiece 
				will not only keep you on your toes because of the constant suspicion, it will also shed some light on the incredible social tension that existed in the 1970s 
				at the height of the Cold War.
