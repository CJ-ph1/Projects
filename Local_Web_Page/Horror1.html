				Summary:<br>
				Originally published in 1954, The Bad Seed was an instant bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award. 
				It’s eerily plausible and a wholly disturbing portrait of a seemingly innocent little girl named Rhoda, who always seems to be at the center of terrible accidents. 
				Her mother’s realization that Rhoda may actually be the cause of the so-called accidents and her own potential hand in that sits at the novel’s controversial and unsettling center. 
				The Bad Seed implacably builds toward its shocking climax in a way that few other similar novels have matched.
