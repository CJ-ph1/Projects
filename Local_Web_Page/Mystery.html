				Summary:<br>
				Perhaps better known by its major motion picture adaptation, Gone Girl is the ultimate mystery puzzle for 
				the modern media age. Devoted wife Amy’s sudden disappearance throws Nick Dunne into a hailstorm of suspicion
				from her parents to his neighbours to the investigators, everyone leans towards believing that he is somehow responsible. 
				Nick himself becomes aware of how his wife viewed him, as well as how little he knows of her, when stories of her emerge from friends 
				he’s never heard of. Even if you’ve failed to keep the media buzz regarding the movie adaptation from spoiling you, the experience 
				of reading the minds of these unreliable narrators is well-worth picking this one up.
