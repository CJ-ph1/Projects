				<p>Author: Mary Shelley<br>
				Characters: Victor Frankenstein<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Mary Shelley started writing classic gothic thriller Frankenstein when she was 18 years old. 
				Two centuries later, it is a major ancestor of both the science fiction and horror genres, tackling huge themes like the nature of life and death, 
				immortality and genetic engineering. It is a pro-science novel that at its heart shows Dr Frankenstein as the callous fiend of the story, 
				who created a being and was not willing to accept responsibility for his actions. In an age where the space between technical life and death is narrower than ever, 
				and scientists are playing with the makeup of what makes us humans, Frankenstein can still teach an important lesson: just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
