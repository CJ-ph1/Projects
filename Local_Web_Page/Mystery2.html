				<p>Author: Truman Capote<br>
				Characters: Herb Clutter, Al Dewey<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				As it’s based on a real-life case that has already been solved, you might think all the mystery is taken out of Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. 
				Fortunately, that couldn’t be more wrong, because this nonfiction novel is one of the best-selling crime stories of all time. Capote had closely followed the 
				investigation of a quadruple murder in Kansas, and was doing a bit of inerviewing himself before the murderers were caught. 
				As a result, his book is filled with twists and turns you would not expect surely such vile behaviors must be works of fiction?
