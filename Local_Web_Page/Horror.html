				<p>Author: H.P.Lovecraft<br>
				Characters: Pabodie, the engineer, Lake, the biologist, and Danforth, the neurasthenic youth<br><br>
				Summary:<br>
				Itâ€™s virtually impossible to discuss modern horror without mention of H.P. Lovecraft. 
				The brand of cosmic horror he created one premised on the inconsequentiality of man in the face of otherworldly beings 
				of unimaginable power has influenced countless authors who follow in his considerable wake. At the Mountains of Madness serves as ground zero 
				for much of the mythos Lovecraft created and centers around an arctic expedition gone horribly wrong after the discovery of a lost extraterrestrial 
				race known as Elder Things. Unfortunately, no discussion of Lovecraft should be had without acknowledging his particularly virulent xenophobia, racism, and adherence to white supremacy.
